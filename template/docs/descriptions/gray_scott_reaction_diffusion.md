# `gray_scott_reaction_diffusion` - Pattern formation in the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion equations

**One line description of the data:** Stable Turing patterns emerge from randomness, with drastic qualitative differences in pattern dynamics depending on the equation parameters.

**Longer description of the data:** The Gray-Scott equations are a set of coupled reaction-diffusion equations describing two chemical species, $A$ and $B$, whose concentrations vary in space and time. The two parameters $f$ and $k$ control the “feed” and “kill” rates in the reaction. A zoo of qualitatively different static and dynamic patterns in the solutions are possible depending on these two parameters. There is a rich landscape of pattern formation hidden in these equations.

**Domain expert**: [Daniel Fortunato](https://danfortunato.com/), CCM and CCB, Flatiron Institute.

**Code or software used to generate the data**: [Github repository](https://github.com/danfortunato/spectral-gray-scott) (MATLAB R2023a, using the stiff PDE integrator implemented in `Chebfun`. The Fourier spectral method is used in space (with nonlinear terms evaluated pseudospectrally), and the exponential time-differencing fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme (ETDRK4) is used in time.)

**Equation describing the data** 

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} &= \delta_A\Delta A - AB^2 + f(1-A) \nonumber \\
\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} &= \delta_B\Delta B - AB^2 - (f+k)B \nonumber
\end{align}

The dimensionless parameters describing the behavior are: $f$ the rate at which $A$ is replenished (feed rate), $k$ the rate at which $B$ is removed from the system, and  $\delta_A, \delta_B$ the diffusion coefficients of both species.

**Approximate time to generate the data:** 5.5 hours per set of parameters, 33 hours total.

**Hardware used to generate the data:** 40 CPU cores.

# What is interesting and challenging about the data:

**What phenomena of physical interest are catpured in the data:** Pattern formation: by sweeping the two parameters $f$ and $k$, a multitude of steady and dynamic patterns can form from random initial conditions.

**How to evaluate a new simulator operating in this space:** It would be impressive if a simulator—trained only on some of the patterns produced by a subset of the $(f, k)$ parameter space—could perform well on an unseen set of parameter values $(f, k)$ that produce fundamentally different patterns. Stability for steady-state patterns over long rollout times would also be impressive.
