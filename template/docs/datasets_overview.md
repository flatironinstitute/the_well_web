# About the data sets

This is a stub for the data set overview page.

This page is what the users will see when they select "Data sets" in the navigation panel.

Please edit this page to replace this nonsense filler text with a useful
overview of the data sets.

Here is an example of math notation $ \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx $

Here is an equation on its own line

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}
$$

Please edit this stub to make it into a meaningful overview.
