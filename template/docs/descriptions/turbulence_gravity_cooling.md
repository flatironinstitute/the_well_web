# turbulence gravity cooling

This is a stub description for the simulation named `turbulence gravity cooling`.  

Here is an example of math notation $ \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx $

Here is an equation on its own line

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}
$$

Please edit this stub to make it into a meaningful description for `turbulence gravity cooling`.
