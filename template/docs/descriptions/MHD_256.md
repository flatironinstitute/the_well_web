# `MHD` - Magnetohydrodynamics compressible turbulence

**NOTE:** This dataset is available in two different resolutions $256^3$ for `MHD_256` and $64^3$ for `MHD_64`. The data was first generated at $256^3$ and then downsampled to $64^3$ with a brick wall filter.

**One line description of the data:** This is an magnetohydrodynamic fluid flow in the compressible limit (subsonic, supersonic, sub-Alfvenic, super-Alfvenic).

**Longer description of the data:** An essential component of the solar wind, galaxy formation, and of interstellar medium (ISM) dynamics is magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. This dataset consists of isothermal MHD simulations without self-gravity (such as found in the diffuse ISM) initially generated with resolution $256^3$ and then downsampled to $64^3$ after anti-aliasing with an ideal low-pass filter.

**Code or software used to generate the data**: Fortran + MPI.

**Equation**: 

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) &= 0 \nonumber\\
\frac{\partial \rho \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v} \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{B} \mathbf{B}) + \nabla p &= 0 \nonumber\\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \nabla \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) &= 0 \nonumber\\
\end{align}

where $\rho$ is the density, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity, $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\mathbf{I}$ the identity matrix and $p$ is the gas pressure.
